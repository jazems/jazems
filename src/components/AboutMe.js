        Hey! I'm a sophomore at UC Berkeley dual majoring in Computer Science and Data Science.
        Professionally, I hope to leverage my student background in tech consulting, business
        analysis, and product management to connect engineers and build beautiful, yet robust
        sofware for causes that matter. Currently, I'm a member of Web Development at Berkeley,
        where I am learning full-stack web development in a rigorous curriculum through the use of
        siloed projects, real-world experiences, best practices and industry standards, and
        personalized mentorship. In my free time you'll find me investing in crypto, researching the
        Blockchain space, exploring Berkeley's diverse cuisine, or playing Super Smash Bros. Brawl.
        I am currently seeking internship opportunities for Summer 2022. If you have any questions,
        please don't hestitate to reach out!
