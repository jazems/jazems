        Hey! I'm a second year at UC Berkeley dual majoring in Computer Science and Data Science.
        Professionally, I hope to leverage my student background in software development, tech
        consulting, and product management to build beautiful, yet robust software for causes that
        matter. Currently, I'm a member of Web Development at Berkeley, where I am doing front-end
        web development for industry clients under an agile scrum framework with other product
        managers and engineers. In my free time you'll find me researching and investing in the
        Blockchain space, exploring Berkeley's diverse cuisine, or playing Super Smash Bros. Brawl.
        I am currently seeking internship opportunities for
        <b> Summer 2022</b>. If you have any questions, please don't hestitate to reach out!
